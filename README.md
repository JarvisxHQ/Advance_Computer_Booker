# Advance Computer Labs & Carts Booker
This is a highly graphical and user-friendly calendar application developed for booking labs, laptops and tablets for use by teachers in their classes for learning purposes. Since most teachers don't know which form of tehcnology is the most appropriate for their purpose, the calendar application asks them several questions including type of usage, time and duration of usage and suggests the user the best lab to book which meet the requirements for their use and is also not yet booked by another teacher. There is also an area to search through the various technologies available within the school and a brief description of each technology. Furthermore, each teacher has their own PIN which they use to sign in and the application will automatically recognize the teacher, show their name and bookings as well as booking made by other teachers. There is so much more to this project but can only be experienced as there are not enough words to explain every feature/aspect of this project. Although the main purpose was to make the lives of teachers easier and the booking process much more efficient by making a SMART Calendar/booking system.
